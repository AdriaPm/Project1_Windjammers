# Windjammers - I WAS HIDING STUDIOS

Windjammers is an arcade sports game, in which the main objective of it is to win your opponent in a head-to-head flying disk match. Windjammers is based on classic volleyball/handball matches but adds a frenetic point of view when playing it due to its special features such as the goals, score points, unique characters and special courts.
